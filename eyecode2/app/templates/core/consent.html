<p>IRB Study #0804000155 (97-763)</p>
<h1>INDIANA UNIVERSITY INFORMED CONSENT FOR</h1>
<h2>Concepts and Percepts</h2>
<p>You are invited to participate in a research study of how what we have learned can influence how people think, act, and make decisions.  You were selected as a possible subject because you contacted our research team expressing interest in participating.  We ask that you read this form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be in the study.</p>
<p>The study is being conducted by Dr. Robert Goldstone in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences.</p>
<h3>STUDY PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The purpose of this study is to better understand the ways that people see objects can change as they learn new tasks.</p>
<h3>NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:</h3>
<p>If you agree to participate, you will be one of approximately 15000 subjects who will be participating in this research.</p>
<h3>PROCEDURES FOR THE STUDY:</h3>
<p>If you agree to be in the study, you will be presented with several straightforward tasks to complete.  These tasks will include responding with key strokes to images displayed on a computer monitor and may involve learning what categories objects belong in, determining if objects are identical or related, and transferring what you learn about objects in one training task to a related task.</p>
<p>The entire session should take a maximum of 60 minutes. You may only participate in the experiment once.</p>
<h3>RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:</h3>
<p>Participation in this study involves a potential risk of loss of confidentiality. </p>
<h3>BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:</h3>
<p>An understanding of how people change the way they see the world as they learn can help us to find more efficient methods to teach information and develop technologies that increase the speed of learning. You benefit from this experience because you learn something about how an experiment is designed and conducted, what issues are of interest to cognitive scientists, and what kinds of group behaviors emerge when individuals try to reach their goals in an environment that consists largely of other individuals.</p>
<h3>ALTERNATIVES TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY:</h3>
<p>An alternative to participating in the study is to choose not to participate.</p>
<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
<p>Efforts will be made to keep your personal information confidential.  We cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.  Your personal information may be disclosed if required by law. Your identity will be held in confidence in reports in which the study may be published and in databases in which results may be stored.  Organizations that may inspect and/or copy your research records for quality assurance and data analysis include groups such as the study investigator and his/her research associates, the IUB Institutional Review Board or its designees, and (as allowed by law) state or federal agencies, specifically the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP), etc. who may want to access your research records. </p>
